# vibration_predictor
This project demonstrates a complete ML deployment workflow for predictive maintenance. It processes raw high-frequency vibration signals, extracts time/frequency-domain features, scales them, and serves an XGBoost fault classifier through a FastAPI endpoint packaged in Docker and deployed on AWS ECS.
